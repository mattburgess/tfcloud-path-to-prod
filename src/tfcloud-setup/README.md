# Terraform Cloud Setup

This chapter will help you to configure the following Terraform Cloud resources, and will do so using Terraform itself. By the end of this chapter you will have:

* A Terraform Cloud Organization
* A Terraform Cloud Project
* A Terraform Cloud Workspace
* Integration between the Workspace and a GitHub repository such that commits to that repository will trigger a `terraform plan` in Terraform Cloud
